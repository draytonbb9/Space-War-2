# Drayton Bohnstadt - Space War

## CONTROLS:
   CONTROLLER Required:
        Left Stick - Move left, right, up, down
        A - Shoot
	X - Restart, go to next cut scene

## Instructions:
    You as a single fighter pilot must destroy all the enemies before they
    reach you or kill you!

## Backstory:
    You vs these red dudes. You only got one shot at defeating them and it requires speed, skill and more than anything *in Professor McGonagall's voice* sheer dumb luck. Sike these guys are kinda trash but they are annoying. Imagine stepping on a lego, this is that in spaceship form. Its not catastrophic, just plain annoying. It does though get more challenging as the dudes get closer to you so you might wanna keep a few laser beams distance away from 'em. Alright you're turn, you'll do great kid unless you're related to Sean Bean, if so, welp nice knowing ya. (Get it, cause Sean Bean dies in like every movie he's ever been in)
